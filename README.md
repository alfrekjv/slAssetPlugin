	$ cd plugins && git clone git@github.com:senico/slAssetPlugin.git

### enable the plugin in the config/ProjectConfiguration class ###

	public function setup()
	{
		$this->enablePlugins('slAssetPlugin');
	}

## Configuration ##

Update the settings.yml file in every application where you want to use this plugin so that plugin module can be used:

	enabled_modules: [slAsset]
	standard_helpers: [slAsset]

###Configuring the plugin###

In your app.yml file you specify the files that have to be compressed and included in your collection. 

	sl_asset:
	    yuipath: bin/yuicompressor-2.4.7.jar # path to the yuicompressor jar file.
	    dir: build/                          # Optional: dir where the compressed files will be stored -- if not defined, it'll store the files on the sf_web/css dir.
	    javascript:
	      default:                           # To be loaded on the Default Module
	        name: main                       # name of the bundle.
	        files: 
	          - lib/jquery-1.6.4.min.js
	          - main.js
	        version: 0
	      default/index:                     # to be loaded on the default/index action.
	        name: index
	        files:
	          - lib/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.min.js
	          - login.js
	        version: 0
	    css:
	      default:
	        name: main
	        files:
	          - lib/bootstrap.min.css
	          - main.css
	        version: 0
	      default/index:
	        name: index
	        files:
	          - lib/cupertino/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.css
	        version: 0
	    options:
	      linebreak: 0
	      verbose: false
	      nomunge: false
	      semi: false
	      nooptimize: false

### Options ###

	Option: type
	YUI Param: --type
     	 
	The type of compressor (JavaScript or CSS) is chosen based on the
	extension of the input file name (.js or .css) This option is required
	if no input file has been specified. Otherwise, this option is only
	required if the input file extension is neither 'js' nor 'css'.

	Option: linebreak
	YUI Param: --line-break
      
	Some source control tools don't like files containing lines longer than,
	say 8000 characters. The linebreak option is used in that case to split
	long lines after a specific column. It can also be used to make the code
	more readable, easier to debug (especially with the MS Script Debugger)
	Specify 0 to get a line break after each semi-colon in JavaScript, and
	after each rule in CSS.

	Option: verbose
	YUI Param: -v, --verbose
      
	Display informational messages and warnings.

	Option: nomunge
	YUI Param: --nomunge
      
	Minify only. Do not obfuscate local symbols.

	Option: semi
	YUI Param: --preserve-semi
      
	Preserve unnecessary semicolons (such as right before a '}') This option
	is useful when compressed code has to be run through JSLint (which is the
	case of YUI for example)

	Option: nooptimize
	YUI Param: --disable-optimizations
      
	Disable all the built-in micro optimizations.

## Compressing the files, task powered ##

This plugin provides a CLI task to combine and compress your asset collections. When you use the task a new file will be generated in the sf_web_dir/js and/or sf_web_dir/css directory combining and minifying the files. A version number is included into the filename if specified.

### Make sure your css and js directories are writable. ###

To combine and compress all assets for the frontend application, run:

	php symfony senico:compress frontend --type=all

To combine and compress only the javascript files for the frontend application, run:

	php symfony senico:compress frontend --type=js

To combine and compress only the css files for the frontend application, run:

	php symfony senico:compress frontend --type=css

## Workflow ##

1) Configure your app.yaml as described before.

2) Execute the task to compress the files.

3) Use the helper functions on your layout file to include the files:

	<?php sl_include_stylesheet(); ?>
	<?php sl_include_javascript(); ?>

If you are on development mode, it would use the uncompressed files, else, if you're on production mode it will include the compressed file bundles.

Note: A good practice is to generate a file bundle for each module/action where you have defined assets as on your view.yml file.
